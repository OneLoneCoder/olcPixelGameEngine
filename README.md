Hang on! I'm looking for Javidx9's video source code! It's moved here: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/Javidx9

# olcPixelGameEngine
The official distribution of olcPixelGameEngine, a tool used in javidx9's YouTube videos and projects.

**You only need the one file - olcPixelGameEngine.h - included in your project!**

Provides a fast, richly featured, cross platform pixel drawing and user interface framework for
 * The development of games
 * Visualisation of algorithms
 * Prototyping and experimentation
 * Education

olcPixelGameEngine is easily extended! for example:
 * 2D Affine transforms
 * 3D Software renderer
 * Controller input
 * Sound
 * Hardware interfaces
 
olcPixelGameEngine is easy to port! Runs on:
 * Windows (all)
 * Linux / Raspberry Pi / ChromeOS
